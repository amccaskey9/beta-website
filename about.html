      I started this journey as a lost, twenty something who wanted an
      “unorthodox” life for myself - where I didn't have to log 40 hours a week
      and schedule my life around work. I wanted to be doing something I truly
      enjoyed, without the worry of financial stability, and have a good quality
      of life.
      <div>
        The first time I seen code was on Tumblr in themes around 2013. I
        revisited that interest at the end of 2021 and started researching the
        best free ways to learn code. I found
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and
        used their free version for a few months to get my feet wet. I enjoyed
        it, but I needed something with guided hands-on experience. February
        2022, my sister sent me a link to
        <a href="https://www.shecodes.io" target="_blank">SheCodes</a>. At the
        time, I had just quit my job and decided to take a moment to really
        think about what I wanted in life. I was hesitant to pay for a workshop
        to learn coding for a few reasons:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I was unemployed and that money could be used for something else
        </li>
        <li>I could finish this workshop more confused than before</li>
      </ul>

      A week after I visited the website, I decided I had nothing to lose by
      investing in myself and took the dive. I completed the workshop on time,
      despite life happening and starting a few days late, and everything
      changed. From there, I kept finding ways to learn code and practice what I
      learned. I set a goal to be confident in calling myself a front end
      developer by my 26th birthday and went for it.
      <div>
        Big thanks to Matt and the team at SheCodes for helping me find my
        passion and turn my dreams into a reality!
